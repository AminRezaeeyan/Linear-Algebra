# Linear Algebra Projects

This repository contains the projects and assignments for the **Linear Algebra** course at **Amirkabir University of Technology**  @aut-ce. The projects involve using linear algebra concepts in practical applications. Projects are implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to follow the steps, computations, and visualizations.

## Projects

### 1. Leontief Input-Output Model
The **Leontief Input-Output Model** is an economic model that represents the interdependencies between different industries in an economy. This project simulates the model using linear algebra to calculate outputs based on inputs across industries.

- **Project location**: [`Leontief-Model`](./Leontief-Model/leontief.ipynb)
- **Topics covered**: Matrices, row echelon form (REF) of a matrice, row reduced echelon form (RREF) of a matrice , linear equations.
