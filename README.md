# Linear Algebra Projects

This repository contains the projects, assignments, and lectures for the **Linear Algebra** course at **Amirkabir University of Technology** (@aut-ce). The projects involve using linear algebra concepts in practical applications. Projects are implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to follow the steps, computations, and visualizations.

**Course Master:** Dr. Ehsan Nazerfard

## Projects

### 1. [`Leontief Model`](./Projects/Leontief%20Model/Leontief.ipynb)
The **Leontief Input-Output Model** is an economic model that represents the interdependencies between different industries in an economy. This project simulates the model using linear algebra to calculate outputs based on inputs across industries.

- **Topics covered**: Matrices, row echelon form (REF) of a matrix, row reduced echelon form (RREF) of a matrix, linear equations.

### 2. [`PageRank Algorithm`](./Projects/PageRank%20Algorithm/PageRank.ipynb)
The **PageRank Algorithm** is used by search engines to rank web pages in their search results. This project demonstrates the application of linear algebra in calculating the PageRank of web pages based on their link structure. 

- **Topics covered**: Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, power iteration method.
